    "The Weather Company (formally WSI), an IBM Business, helps people make informed decisions and take action in the face of weather. The company offers the most personalized, and actionable weather data and insights to millions of consumers, as well as thousands of marketers and businesses via Weather’s API, its business solutions division, and its own digital products from [The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/) and [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/).\n",

The data also revealed The gap between The Weather Company and the next best overall provider has incresed every year of the study."
